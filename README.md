# Matrix Library

This repository contains a simple implementation of a matrix class in C++. The `matrix` class provides functionalities for creating and manipulating matrices of double values. 

## Features

- **Matrix Creation**: Create matrices of specified dimensions.
- **Filling Matrices**: Fill matrices with specified values from a vector.
- **Getting and Setting Elements**: Access and modify individual elements in the matrix.
- **Printing Matrices**: Display matrices in a formatted way.
- **Changing Shape**: Resize matrices and adjust their dimensions.
- **Fitting Shapes**: Fit new data into a matrix with the option to fill missing values.

## Files

- `matrix.h`: Header file containing the declaration of the `matrix` class and its member functions.
- `matrix.cpp`: Implementation file with the definitions of the `matrix` class member functions.

## Usage

### 1. Include the Header

To use the matrix class in your project, include the `matrix.h` header file:

```cpp
#include "matrix.h"
